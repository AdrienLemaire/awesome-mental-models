## Mental models list

### Economics

* Supply and Demand
* **Fear of Missing Out (FOMO)**: A pervasive apprehension that others might be
  having rewarding experiences from which one is absent.
* **Preferred Stock vs Common Stock**: Preferred stock is a type of stock which
  may have any combination of features not possessed by common stock including
  properties of both an equity and a debt instrument, and is generally
  considered a hybrid instrument.
* **Margin of Safety**: The difference between the intrinsic value of a stock
  and its market price.
* **Investing vs Speculation**: Typically, high-risk trades that are almost akin
  to gambling fall under the umbrella of speculation, whereas lower-risk
  investments based on fundamentals and analysis fall into the category of
  investing.
* **Compound Interest**: Interest on interest. It is the result of reinvesting
  interest, rather than paying it out, so that interest in the next period is
  then earned on the principal sum plus previously-accumulated interest.

### Psychology

* **Cialdini's 6 principles of influence**:
  * Commitment (“If people commit…they are more likely to honor that
    commitment.”)
  * Liking (“People are easily persuaded by other people they like.”)
  * Authority (“People will tend to obey authority figures.”)
  * Scarcity(“Perceived scarcity will generate demand”).
  * Social Proof (“People will do things they see other people are doing.”)
  * Reciprocity (“People tend to return a favor.”)
* Survivorship Bias
* **Bandwagon**: Appealing to popularity or the fact that many people do something
  as an attempted form of validation.
* **The Socratic method**: getting a "yes, yes" response. He kept on asking
  questions until finally, almost without realizing it, his opponents found
  themselves embracing a conclusion they would have bitterly denied a few
  minutes previously.
* **Pygmalion Effect**: The phenomenon whereby higher expectations lead to an
  increase in performance.  (opposite to the Golem effect).
* **Introversion vs Extroversion**: Extroversion tends to be manifested in outgoing,
  talkative, energetic behavior, whereas introversion is manifested in more
  reserved and solitary behavior
* **IQ vs EQ**: IQ is a total score derived from one of several standardized
  tests designed to assess human intelligence.” “EQ is the capacity of
  individuals to recognize their own, and other people’s emotions, to
  discriminate between different feelings and label them appropriately, and to
  use emotional information to guide thinking and behavior.

### Thinking

* The Scientific Method
* Inversion
* Working Backward
* **Growth Mindset vs Fixed Mindset**: Those with a ‘fixed mindset’ believe that
  abilities are mostly innate and interpret failure as the lack of necessary
  basic abilities, while those with a ‘growth mindset’ believe that they can
  acquire any given ability provided they invest effort or study.
* **Hindsight Bias**: The inclination, after an event has occurred, to see the event
  as having been predictable, despite there having been little or no objective
  basis for predicting it.
* **Hacking Tests**: When evaluating a line of work, ask yourself: "To what
  extent do you win at this kind of work by hacking bad tests?"
  ([The lesson to unlearn](http://paulgraham.com/lesson.html))

### Biology

* Evolution by Natural Selection

### Chemistry

* Activation Energy

### Physics

* **Critical Mass**: The smallest amount of fissile material needed for a sustained
  nuclear chain reaction.
* Relativity
* Velocity
* **Activation Energy**: The minimum energy which must be available to a chemical
  system with potential reactants to result in a chemical reaction.
* **Catalyst**: A substance which increases the rate of a chemical reaction.
* **Leverage**: The force amplification achieved by using a tool, mechanical device
  or machine system
* **Inertia**: the resistance of any physical object to any change in its state of
  motion; this includes changes to its speed, direction or state of rest. It is
  the tendency of objects to keep moving in a straight line at constant
  velocity.
* **Half-life**: the time required for a quantity to reduce to half its initial
  value. The term is commonly used in nuclear physics to describe how quickly
  unstable atoms undergo, or how long stable atoms survive, radioactive decay.
* **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle**: A fundamental limit to the precision with
  which certain pairs of physical properties of a particle, known as
  complementary variables, such as position x and momentum p, can be known.

### Engineering

* Leverage

### Mathematics

* Normal Distribution (Bell Curve)
* Permutations and Combinations
* Power Laws

### Managing

* **Weekly 1–1s**: “1–1’s can add a whole new level of speed and agility to your
  company.”
* Forcing Function — “A forcing function is any task, activity or event that
  forces you to take action and produce a result.”
* **DRI (Directly Responsible Individual)**: good things come if someone is
  explicitly responsible for something. (solution to "diffusion of
  responsibility" effect)
* **Virtual Team**: A group of individuals who work across time, space and
  organizational boundaries with links strengthened by webs of communication
  technology
* **Organizational Debt**: All the people/culture compromises made to ‘just get it
  done’ in the early stages of a startup.
* **Generalist vs Specialist**: A generalist is a person with a wide array of
  knowledge, the opposite of which is a specialist.” (related: hedgehog vs fox —
  “A fox knows many things, but a hedgehog one important thing.

## Mental models groups
Picked from the various books & articles listed above

* **Avoid present bias**: Use **commitment** and the **default effect**.
* **Approaching systems**:
  1. **Local/Global**: start by identifying the highest-leverage level to
     optimize at: Ask whether you’re optimizing the machine or a cog within it
  2. **Theory of Constraints**
  3. **First Principles**
* **Making decisions**
  1. Long-term decisions: **Regret Minimization**
  2. Medium-term decisions: **Pareto's Principle**
  3. Short-term decisions: **ICE**
  4. Day-to-day decisions: **Eisenhower Matrix**


## Logical fallacies

* **Conjunction fallacy**
  * [TED - Can you outsmart this logical
    fallacy?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ghbkv0MKV-w)
